# Pixelburen Minecraft Resource Pack

Pixelburen is a community-made datapack that adds fun new features, challenges, and rewards to your Minecraft world. It’s designed to enhance vanilla gameplay while keeping a balanced and immersive feel.

This resource pack brings the Pixelburen datapack to life with custom models for unique items like the Ender Fish and Chorus Salmon. This pack is purely visual and is designed to be used alongside the Pixelburen datapack.

This resource pack alongside the datapack gives our fans — and anyone else — the chance to enjoy the same features we play with on our private server. It’s designed for **multiplayer**, but works perfectly in singleplayer too. And best of all: it’s 100% vanilla, with no mods required.
